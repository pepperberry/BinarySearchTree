# BinarySearchTree

a BST class and a client program to test it, takes two entered files and tells you the number of nodes, leaves, the BST height, Width, and if its empty.
It also tells you the Pre-order, In-order and Post-order traversals, tests the levels and ancestors, then tests if it has some random numbers/words in it.
the code then removes some and outputs again then adds some diffrent nodes and outputs it again.

The test files can be used to demonstrate a simple balanced BST.
